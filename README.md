Our goals:

1) Make all changes in policies logged. We need to know when and what was changed, who changed it, http_referer and params.

2) Protect policy to change commission from user that have no admin role.

3) DRY

4) * replace acceptance selenium tests that could fail durin long ajax request
(in our case  if products searching or recalculation collection would be too long) to something more reliable.
